# About That Code I Wrote

Here is the story of _that_ ugly _code I wrote_ back in the days. Non shareable, non readable, non reusable and yet, so functional. How proud I was! - don't blame me, you wrote the same ugly code. You invented it.

I had every reason to be proud. A perfectly obfuscated code can be a real asset if you aim to be indispensable. Besides, you can say: "Yeah, that was harsh but you know, that's my job". I'm kidding, nobody thinks that...

From bad designs to shitty hacks, from one bearded IT guy to millions of successive trainees, ugly codes are everywhere. This is especially true in non-computer sciences research area where handcrafted scripts are ubiquitous. When research projects are always more specific than the previous ones, why would you spend time on reusability? When you're alone on your project, why would you spend time on shareability? When you're the only user of your script, why would you spend time on performance and documentation?

These are all totally legitimate questions.

Software industry companies are not perfect either. Automated testing is often considered an inferior job compared to Software developer. It seems so faster and easier to live on hot fixes than to write tests. It is even more glorious. And even with tests, your code is not bug-proof.

If you read those lines, either you're my mom or you want to do better code. In any way, it's nice to have you. Why another programming blog you may ask. Is it better than anyone else? Nope. This is just a modest site where I want to share my experience in Web Development and Software Quality Assurance, especially applied but not limited to Bioinformatics.

I hope you'll enjoy the trip!

# About That Guy I Am

Because there is always a man behind a mistake, here I am. My name is Pierre Dupuis. I am 25 and despite my young age, I am - and/or have been - a lot of things: a bioinformatician, a programmer, a researcher, a project leader, an opensource developer, a system administrator, a software QA manager, a lead tester and even a bench worker.

Holding a Master's degree in both Biology and Computer Sciences, I spent 6 months working in universities abroad, 1 year in a French leading pharmaceutical company, 1 year in the largest fundamental science agency in Europe, 1 year as a software QA manager for a Google partner and I am currently an R&D engineer in a Technology Innovation Institute in Microbiology and Infectiology.
